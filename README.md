[![Linux Build](https://github.com/azimut/scenic/actions/workflows/linux.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/azimut/scenic/actions/workflows/linux.yml)
[![Windows Build](https://github.com/azimut/scenic/actions/workflows/windows.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/azimut/scenic/actions/workflows/windows.yml)

Yet another toy demo/graphics toolkit. Using CEPL.

Next iteration after, [https://github.com/azimut/shiny](azimut/shiny) and [https://github.com/azimut/incandescent/](azimut/incandescent).

## Why?

- Clean the old repos.
- Stop relying of loosely related global variables.
- Have an easy way to define multiple lights/shadows.
- To support multiple "scenes".
- To pass the time.

## NOTE

It needs some forks/libraries not on quicklisp. See [https://github.com/azimut/scenic/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml#L72](main.yml)
