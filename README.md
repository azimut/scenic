# scenic

Yet another toy demo/graphics toolkit. Using CEPL.

Next iteration after, azimut/shiny and azimut/incandescent.

## Why?

- Clean the old repos.
- Stop relying of loosely related global variables.
- Have an easy way to define multiple lights/shadows.
- To support multiple "scenes".
- To pass the time.
